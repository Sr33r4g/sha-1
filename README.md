# sha-1


Just writing my first hashing algorithm.....

I'll be implementing SHA-1 and will optimize it wherever possible.

This is just going to be an experimentation so as to strengthen my base in C++ programming. This code is free to be used by anyone provided they cite me as the head contributor in the work.
Free to use for it educational purpose.
